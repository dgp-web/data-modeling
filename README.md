# data modeling

The ``data-modeling`` library contains TypeScript interfaces that help describe complex domains with 
[Generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html), [Mapped types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html),
and concepts from storage paradigms such as [redux](https://redux.js.org/).

From a JavaScript perspective, there is nothing in this library, ``data modeling`` has no opinion about what happens
at runtime while enabling programmers to derive complex structures from simple ones and providing mental scaffolds
at design time.

We like to think about ``data-modeling`` as experiences cast into flexible interfaces geared towards
building sophisticated data-handling in application systems relying on TypeScript.

## Features
